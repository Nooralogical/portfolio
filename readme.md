LevelCam adroid app was a team project in autumn 2018. The goal was to create an Android app for measuring angles shown on the camera display. I was responsible for the styling of the finished app, which I implemented based on my UI design. For better usability, I also added two switch buttons to hide/unhide elements on the app screen.
