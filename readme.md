## UX and UI design

### SELL Games application UI design

* Adobe Xd
* Menu icons are placeholders ([Allumi icon set](https://www.xdguru.com/allumi-xd-icon-set/))

In the autumn 2018, I designed the UI layouts and functionalites for the SELL Student Games event application. This is a client project inside our university and all designs where created with the client's needs and requirements in mind. I was part of the application team at the design and prototype phases. Actual implementation of the designs can be found [here](#SELL-Games-Ionic-application).

The application itself will be in use in the spring of 2020 at the Student games in Lahti. The designs are specifically designed to work for a sports event with a lot of the different sports and tight scheduling. The main goal was to create a clear and easy-to-use application the participants and the audience can use during the event.

SELL Student Games application is currently a prototype app constructed based on my UI designs. Aside from the UI designs, I was responsible for all the css styling, page routing and Ionic components. I also worked on the calendar and sport listing page functionalities while I lead the team as the scrum master.

This team project is continuing in spring 2019 with me still in the team.

LevelCam adroid app was a team project in autumn 2018. The goal was to create an Android app for measuring angles shown on the camera display. I was responsible for the styling of the finished app, which I implemented based on my UI design. For better usability, I also added two switch buttons to hide/unhide elements on the app screen.
