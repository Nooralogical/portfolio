## UX and UI design

### SELL Games application UI design

* **Adobe Xd**
* Menu icons are placeholders ([Allumi icon set](https://www.xdguru.com/allumi-xd-icon-set/))

In the autumn 2018, I designed the UI layouts and functionalites for the SELL Student Games event application. This is a client project inside our university and all designs where created with the client's needs and requirements in mind. I was part of the application team at the design and prototype phases. Actual implementation of the designs can be found [here](#SELL-Games-Ionic-application).

The application itself will be in use in the spring of 2020 at the Student games in Lahti. The designs are specifically designed to work for a sports event with a lot of the different sports and tight scheduling. The main goal was to create a clear and easy-to-use application the participants and the audience can use during the event.

LevelCam was an Android application project in the autumn of 2018, in which my responsibility was to design and implement a clean and easy-to-use single page layout. 

The application is a tool for measuring angles show in the camera view by moving the line on the display. All other elements of the application (compass and lux measurement)where designed to work as fragments over the camera view. To prevent the view from getting too busy, the user were given the option to hide elements.

On the left is the initial design and then the finished look of the application at the end of development. 

The development of the application can be found [here](#LevelCam-Android-application).

## Frontend

!Professional work, no source codes available

In the summer of 2018, I worked as a junior Drupal developer in Helsinki. I was given the opportunity to design the look of the webstore and implement the frontend & backend as well as work as the client contact for this project. I worked together with a senior developer on this project from start to launch and was assisted and instructed on the Drupal side of the project but all frontend work fully done by me.

LevelCam adroid app was a team project in autumn 2018. The goal was to create an Android app for measuring angles shown on the camera display. The inspiration was a team member who worked as a solar panel fitter and needed a tool for measuring the roof angles while working. Other elements, compass and lux measurements were added as handy tools for the user.

I was responsible for the styling of the finished app, which I implemented based on my UI design found [here](#LevelCam-application-design). For better usability, I also added two switch buttons to hide/unhide elements on the app screen.
