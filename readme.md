# About

Hi you, Noora here! I'm a software engineering student @ **Lahti University of Applied Sciences** and graduating in autumn 2019, if the planets align. I'm programmer with a strong design background. Even though, I'm comfortable with frontend technologies, I'm not afraid to tackle the backend either. Projects here include school work, professional work and personal projects, which I hope will demostrate the scope of different subjects I'm curious about and have experience in.

## UX and UI design

### SELL Games application UI design

![SELL front](/images/sellapp.png "SELL app front")
![SELL menu](/images/sellappmenu.png "SELL app menu")

* **Adobe Xd**
* Menu icons are placeholders ([Allumi icon set](https://www.xdguru.com/allumi-xd-icon-set/))

In the autumn 2018, I designed the UI layouts and functionalites for the SELL Student Games event application. This is a client project inside our university and all designs where created with the client's needs and requirements in mind. I was part of the application team at the design and prototype phases. Actual implementation of the designs can be found [here](#SELL-Games-Ionic-application).

The application itself will be in use in the spring of 2020 at the Student games in Lahti. The interface is specifically designed to work for a multisport event with tight scheduling. The main goal was to create a clear and easy-to-use application the participants and the audience can use during the event.

### LevelCam application design

![LevelCam design](/images/levelcam-design.jpg "LevelCam App UI design")

* **Adobe Xd**
* Icons made with **Adobe Photoshop CC**

LevelCam was an Android application project in the autumn of 2018, in which my responsibility was to design and implement a clean and easy-to-use single page layout. 

The application is a tool for measuring angles show in the camera view by moving the line on the display. All other elements of the application (compass and lux measurement) were designed to work as fragments over the camera view. To prevent the view from getting too busy, the user were given the option to hide the elements.

On the left is the initial design and on the right, the application at the end of [development](#LevelCam-Android-application).

## Frontend

### GasreSports Drupal webstore

![GasreSports front](/images/gasrefront.png "GasreSports front")

* **Drupal 8 & Commerce**
* **PHP**
* **Sass & Compass**
* **Axure RP** used for wireframes
* Icons made with **Adobe Photoshop CC**

!Professional work, no source codes available

In the summer of 2018, I worked as a junior Drupal developer in Helsinki. I was given the opportunity to design the look of the webstore and implement the frontend & backend as well as work as the client contact for this project. I worked together with a senior developer from start to launch and was assisted and instructed on the Drupal side of the project but all frontend work was fully designed and done by me.

### SELL Games Ionic application

![SELL front](/images/sellfront.png "SELL app front")
![SELL calendar](/images/sellcal.png "SELL app calendar")

* **Ionic 4** & Ionic components
* **Angular & Cordova**
* **TypeScript**
* **HTML & CSS**

SELL Student Games application is currently a prototype constructed based on my UI [designs](#SELL-Games-application-UI-design). Aside from the designs, I was responsible for all the css styling, page routing and Ionic components. I also worked on the calendar and sport listing page functionalities while I lead the team as the scrum master.

This project is continuing in spring 2019 with me still in the team.

### LevelCam Android application

![LevelCam final product](/images/levelcam-final.jpg "LevelCam App")
![LevelCam elements hidden](/images/levelcamhidden.jpg "LevelCam App buttons")

* **Android Studio**
* **Java**
* **XML** styling

LevelCam Android application was a team project in autumn 2018. The goal was to create an Android app for measuring angles shown on the camera display. The inspiration was a team member who worked as a solar panel fitter and needed a tool for measuring the roof angles while working. Other elements, compass and lux measurements were added as handy tools for the user.

I was responsible for the styling of the finished app, which I implemented based on my UI design found [here](#LevelCam-application-design). For better usability, I also added two switch buttons to hide/unhide elements on the app screen.

## Game development

### Finnish Game Jam 2018 game

![Robot's mission header](/images/robotheader.png "Robot's mission game")

* **Unity**
* **C#**
* 48 hours & 1 bag of crisps

I took part in the Finnish Game Jam 2018, where we designed and developed a game during 48 hours. The year's theme was Transmission and our team came up with a 2D platformer, where a robot is looking for his friend's body parts inside an abandoned factory. Idea was to utilize our sound designer as much as possible by adding unique sounds for each part. I was both the lead programmer and game designer for this game. More details and all source codes can be found at the [Global Game Jam Game site](https://globalgamejam.org/2018/games/robots-mission).

### Hotline LAMK GameMaker Studio 2 game

![Hotline LAMK header](/images/hotlineheader.png "Hotline LAMK game")

* **GameMaker Studio 2**
* **GameMaker Language**
* 2D graphics made with [Pixelart](https://www.pixilart.com) & **Adobe Photoshop CC**

This project was inspired by the Hotline Miami game, because we used the same game engine to create ours. Idea was to create a game where you would navigate Lahti UAS new campus building section with computer labs and design workshops. You get study points for each classroom you find and finally graduate when you have enough points. Exactly like real life! 

I worked on some programming parts like the main menu, pause menu ja GUI elements. However I was mainly responsible for the 2D graphics and animations.

## Backend and others

### Node.js & Express REST API server

* **Node.js**
* **Express**
* **mySQL**

REST API server made with Node.js and web framework Express. Uses GET, POST, PUT and DELETE methods to mofidy details in mySQL database. Tested with a client and Postman API development environment.

### Bubble Generator with ECMAScript 6

* **ECMAScript 6**
* **HTML5**

This is a simple piece of code, I did to practise working with ES6 and HTML5 canvas element. With simple code changes, the amount of bubbles, interval and bubble speed can be modified.

### Filters and Pipes with C

* **C**

I added this collection of C programs to demostrate I'm not afraid of C languages! The 6 short programs are filters for standard input. They produce filtered output and can be piped together to filter any input like source code or text files. See repository for more specific instructions on how to.
